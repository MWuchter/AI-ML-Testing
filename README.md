AI & Machine Learning Experiments

A collection of small-scale AI and machine learning projects exploring data processing, model training, and algorithm experimentation.
Each project focuses on testing and understanding different ML concepts using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on the project).
